# Adding a New Feature

When starting a new feature, this is a typical workflow:

1. [Create or modify any related API schema, types and hooks](./api-how-tos.md). Use [swagger](http://localhost:3000/api) as a guide.
2. [Add any new routes, pages, and menu items](./routing-how-tos.md). Add a `RoutePageTitle` but otherwise leave the pages blank for now.
3. Create any customized [DataGrid](./data-grid-how-tos.md) components, and/or [FormGrid](./forms-how-tos.md) components.
4. Assemble all the pieces into the pages. [Create any forms](./forms-how-tos.md) needed there as well.
5. Complete the UX with additional content, links, confirmation dialogs, etc.
